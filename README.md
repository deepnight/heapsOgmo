# About

A simple lib to import **Ogmo 3** maps to Heaps projects. It only supports basic stuff, and it's not meant to support 100% of all Ogmo features. If you need all advanced Ogmo features, you can install:

``haxelib install ogmo-3``

See: https://github.com/Ogmo-Editor-3/ogmo-3-lib

# Usage

See `./test/src/Main.hx`.
